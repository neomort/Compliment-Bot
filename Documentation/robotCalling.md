### RobotCalling
## By Abdi Ambari, Kyle Adams, Genie Hou

# Concept and Inspiration
	For this week’s topic of Biopower, we want to explore the connection between power and body / personal spaces. Inspired by the recent development in China, where the government sends out robots and drones to keep track of people’s whereabouts to enforce the lockdown policy, we want to explore the boundary between humans and robots. Are you comfortable with having robots gazing at you? What are the actions that are socially acceptable enacted by robots? What if a robot compliments a random stranger? Through this art project, we will also like to dive into the examination of the distinction between catcalling and complementing. Maybe because robots are not in the traditional gendered biopolitical structure, people won’t feel uncomfortable receiving compliments from an unknown robot. The compliments our robot is programmed to give out are not traditionally perceived as disrespectful, which gives the audience space to reflect on the nuances behind catcalling. At the same time, the project examines the relationship humans established while receiving that compliment from a non-human object.
We were inspired by the art piece Housewives making drugs by Mary Maggic. Being failed by the traditional biopolitical power structure, the housewives decided to make their own estrogen and take back the control of their body that is rightfully theirs. Our project wants to discuss similar subjects, examing the power relationships behind catcalling, the manifestation of the patriarchal society, through the robot’s futuristic form.
